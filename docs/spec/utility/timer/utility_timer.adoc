== Purpose and Scope

This document describes the specifications of the Timer provided as a Utility. + 
The purpose of the Timer is to provide timer functionality to upper layers such as ESF and SystemApp.

== Component Description
The Timer layer provides timer functionality to upper layers.

=== Component Overview

Below is a software configuration diagram centered on this block.

=== Detailed Component Description
Examples of Timer usage are shown below. +
Upper layers that use the Timer functionality can use various Timer APIs immediately after the UtilityTimerInitialize sequence is executed. +

=== State Transition
The possible states of TIMER are shown in <<#_TableStates>>.

[#_TableStates]
.List of States
[width="100%", cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
|State |Description 

|TIMER_READY
|Initial state.

|TIMER_RUNNING
|Runnable state.

|TIMER_START
|State where the timer is started. +
*This is a sub-state of TIMER_RUNNING, and the state is maintained for each timer.* +

|TIMER_STOP
|State where the timer is stopped. +
*This is a sub-state of TIMER_RUNNING, and the state is maintained for each timer.* +

|===

In Timer, state transitions are performed as shown in <<#_FigureState>>. +
Also, if an error occurs in each API, no state transition will occur. +

[#_FigureState]
.State Transition Diagram
image::./images/timer_state.png[scaledwidth="100%",align="center"]

The acceptability of APIs and the destination state for each state are shown in <<#_TableStateTransition>>. +
TIMER_RUNNING has sub-states, which are shown in the second row of the table. +
Sub-states are maintained for each timer, and state management starts with timer creation and ends with timer deletion. +

The state names in the table indicate the destination state after API execution is completed, and indicate that the API can be called. +
× indicates that the API cannot be accepted, and calling the API here will return an error and no state transition will occur. +
- indicates that the state is no longer managed after the state transition. +

kUtilityTimerRepeat: Repeated, kUtilityTimerOneShot: Only once

* *Return Value* +
One of the UtilityTimerErrCode values will be returned according to the execution result.

* *Description* +
** Starts the timer.
** This API can be used after UtilityTimerInitialize has been executed.
** If the specified timer is already started, an error will be returned. +
** If the value is outside the minimum/maximum range that can be specified for the timer, an error will be returned. +
The minimum/maximum values can be obtained with UtilityTimerGetSystemInfo.
** The specified cycle will be rounded up to the minimum unit cycle of the timer (= minimum value that can be specified for the timer). +
Example: If the minimum unit cycle is assumed to be 10ns and 15ns is specified, it will be processed as a 20ns timer.
** When utility_timer_repeat_type=kUtilityTimerOneShot, the timer will start and the callback will be executed only once. After the callback is executed, stop the timer with UtilityTimerStop.
** When utility_timer_repeat_type=kUtilityTimerRepeat, the timer will continue to operate and the callback will be executed repeatedly until UtilityTimerStop is called.
** The callback is executed in the thread on the UtilityTimer side.

[#_UtilityTimerGetSystemInfo]
==== UtilityTimerGetSystemInfo
* *Function* +
Can acquire system information related to the timer.

* *Format* +
[source, C]
....
UtilityTimerErrCode UtilityTimerGetSystemInfo(UtilityTimerSystemInfo *utility_timer_sysinfo)
....

* *Description of Arguments* +
**[OUT] struct UtilityTimerSystemInfo *utility_timer_sysinfo**:: 
System information related to the timer.

* *Return Value* +
One of the UtilityTimerErrCode values will be returned according to the execution result.

* *Description* +
** This API can be used after UtilityTimerInitialize has been executed.
** If it fails, the value of utility_timer_sysinfo will remain the same as before this API was executed.

・From "Nuttx Documentation - System Time and Clock", the minimum unit is 100us.

|System Timer
In most implementations, system time is provided by a timer interrupt. That timer interrupt runs at rate determined by
CONFIG_USEC_PER_TICK
(default 10000 microseconds or 100Hz. If
CONFIG_SCHED_TICKLESS
is selected, the default is 100 microseconds).
