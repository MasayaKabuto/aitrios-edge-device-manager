== Purpose and Scope

This document describes the specifications for the I2C implementation, which is one of the impl layers of AITRIOS HAL.

<<<

== Terminology

[#_words]
.Terms List
[options="header"]
|===
|Term |Description 

|HAL
|Hardware Abstract Layer. A layer that absorbs camera differences.

|PL
|Porting Layer. A layer that absorbs camera/OS differences.

|public API
|API that can be used directly from the upper layers.

|private API
|API used only within HAL.
|===

<<<

== Component Description

The HAL impl layer is the main part of the HAL I/F that can be used without considering camera differences. Its purpose is to absorb those differences. 
Additionally, it can be added or modified according to the target camera.

=== Component Overview

The following is a software block diagram centered on this component.

.Overview Diagram

<<<

=== Detailed Component Description

The following shows an example of the usage sequence of HAL I2C.
After executing HalI2cInitialize, the upper layer can perform I2C communication using the HAL I2C API.

=== State Transitions
The states that HAL I2C can transition to are shown in <<#_TableStates>>.

[#_TableStates]
.State List
[width="100%", cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
|State |Description 

|HAL_I2C_READY
|Initial state

|HAL_I2C_RUNNING
|Operational state
|===

In HAL I2C, the state transitions shown in <<#_FigureState>> occur. +
Additionally, state transitions do not occur if an error occurs in any API. +

[#_FigureState]
.State Transition Diagram
image::./images/i2c_state.png[scaledwidth="100%",align="center"]

API acceptance and transition destinations for each state are shown in <<#_TableStateTransition>>. The state names in the table indicate the destination state after API execution, which means the API is callable. +
An "×" indicates that the API is not accepted, in which case the API call returns an error and no state transition occurs. For error details, refer to <<#_HalErrCode, HalErrCode List>>.

* *Function* +
Locks the HAL I2C API.

* *Return Value* +
Returns one of the HalErrCode values based on the execution result.

* *Explanation* +
** Locks the HAL I2C API.
** After executing this API, other HAL I2C APIs will wait until HalI2cUnlock is executed.
** HalI2cLock and HalI2cUnlock must be executed in the same thread, while other HAL I2C APIs should be executed in a different thread from the one that executed this API.
** If other HAL I2C APIs are executed in the same thread before HalI2cUnlock is called, the behavior is not guaranteed.
** This API can be used after HalI2cInitialize is executed.

[#_HalI2cTransfer]

* *Function* +
[HAL Internal API] Executes I2C data communication.

[source, C]
....
HalErrCode HalI2cTransfer(uint32_t device_id, const uint8_t *transfer_data[], const uint8_t transfer_size[], const bool is_read[], uint32_t trans_num, HalI2cEndian dev_endian)
....

* *Explanation of Arguments* +
**[IN] uint32_t device_id**:: 
ID of the target device.

**[IN/OUT] uint8_t *transfer_data[]**:: 
Array of transfer data. The number of elements is trans_num. +
If is_read is true, the read result is stored. +
If is_read is false, the data to be written is stored.

**[IN] uint8_t transfer_size[]**:: 
Array of byte sizes for transfer data. The number of elements is trans_num.

**[IN] bool is_read[]**:: 
Array of flags indicating Read/Write transfer. The number of elements is trans_num. +
Specify true for reading and false for writing.

**[IN] uint32_t trans_num**:: 
The total number of transfers.

**[IN] HalI2cEndian dev_endian**:: 
Specify the endian of the target device's register address. +
** kHalI2cLittleEndian: Little-endian +
** kHalI2cBigEndianfalse: Big-endian

* *Return Value* +
Returns one of the HalErrCode values based on the execution result.

* *Explanation* +
** This is an internal HAL API for executing I2C data communication.
** For a single data transfer, set trans_num to 1 and prepare transfer_data and transfer_size for 1 byte, then use is_read to specify the transfer direction as Read (set to true) or Write (set to false).
** For data communication involving multiple registers, specify the number of registers in trans_num and prepare arrays for transfer_data, transfer_size, and is_read corresponding to that number.
** To transfer both Read and Write data to a single register simultaneously, set trans_num to 2, prepare transfer_data[2] and transfer_size[2], and set is_read[2] to true and false respectively.
** HAL implementers should execute this API from HalI2cReadRegister***/HalI2cWriteRegister***.
** This API blocks internally on the I2C port number connected to the device with the specified device ID, so blocking in the caller is not required.

.Image of Argument Values and Data Transfer
image::./images/i2c_transfer.png[scaledwidth="100%",align="center"]
** trans_num 0 to 4 behavior
*** 0 : Read 1 byte from r_addr into buff (read buffer address)
*** 1 : Write 1 byte of data to w_addr
*** 2 : Write 1 byte of data to w_addr
*** 3 : Read 1 byte from r_addr into buff (read buffer address)
*** 4 : Read 1 byte from r_addr into buff (read buffer address)
