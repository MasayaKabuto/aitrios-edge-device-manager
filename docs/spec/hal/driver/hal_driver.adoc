== Purpose and Scope

This document describes the specifications of the HAL Driver, which is one of the implementation layers of AITRIOS HAL. +
The purpose of the HAL Driver is to absorb board-level differences at the function implementation level that cannot be absorbed by HAL configuration alone, as the processing varies greatly between cameras. +
For example, processes during FW OTA updates involve many chip-dependent procedures, and by creating dedicated driver files and executing the process through the HAL Driver, the impact on other modules can be minimized while ensuring high scalability.

TIP: This module is intended for use only within HAL.

== Component Description

The purpose of the HAL Driver is to absorb board-level differences at the function implementation level that cannot be absorbed by HAL configuration alone, as the processing varies greatly between cameras. +
The HAL Driver is implemented by preparing the HAL Driver I/F and HAL Driver files, and registering the drivers.

=== Detailed Component Description

An example of the usage sequence for the HAL Driver is shown below. +
After executing HalDriverInitialize, other HAL modules can use various driver functions through the HAL Driver API.

[#_Function4]
==== Register New Driver
Function Overview::
Allows adding a HAL Driver with minimal impact on other HAL modules.
Preconditions::
None.
Function Details::

When registering and using a new driver, the following three tasks are generally required:

1. Create a new HAL Driver main file.
2. Add one line to the HAL Driver I/F source to include the new driver's header file and implement ops.
3. Register the driver with the HAL Driver.

Detailed steps for each task are described below.

Behavior Details::

* 1. Create a new HAL Driver main file.
** Create a new header and source file as follows.
** The specification of the void *arg argument in Ioctl is determined by the driver side.
*** It is recommended to prepare a somewhat general-purpose structure that can be reused for similar devices.
**** Instead of defining a structure for each device's .c source file, define a general IOExpander-related struct, long cmd in hal_driver_ioexp.h, and include it in each device's .c source.

[source, C]
.pcal6416aev.h
....
HalErrCode Pcal6416AevOpen(uint32_t device_id);
HalErrCode Pcal6416AevClose(uint32_t device_id);
HalErrCode Pcal6416AevIoctl(void *arg_, uint32_t cmd);

struct HalDriverOps pcal6416aev_ops = {
  .open = Pcal6416AevOpen,
  .close = Pcal6416AevClose,
  .read = NULL,
  .write = NULL,
  .ioctl = Pcal6416AevIoctl,
};
....

[source, C]
.pcal6416aev.c
....
HalErrCode Pcal6416AevOpen(uint32_t device_id) {
  return 0;  // Perform setup if necessary
}

HalErrCode Pcal6416AevClose(uint32_t device_id) {
  return 0;  // Perform close process if necessary
}

HalErrCode Pcal6416AevIoctl(void *arg_, uint32_t cmd) {
  struct ioexp_ioctl_arg *io_arg = (struct ioexp_ioctl_arg*)arg;
  switch (cmd) {
  case IOCTL_CMD_SETVAL:
    int phy_port = io_arg->phy_port;
    int val = io_arg->setval;
    // HalI2cWriteRegister***
    break;
  }
  return 0;
}
....

* 2. Add one line to include the new driver's header file and implement ops in the HAL Driver I/F source.
** Edit the HAL Driver I/F source file as follows.

[source, C]
.hal_driver.c
....
#include "pcal6416aev.h"
#include "pcal6408ahkx.h"  // ★Added

struct hal_driver_info {
  uint32_t device_id;
  char dev_name[32];
  struct HalDriverOps* ops;
};

....

* 3. Register the driver with the HAL Driver.
** Use the HalDriverAddDriver API to register the driver.
** Ensure that the device_id does not conflict with other devices (usually assign consecutive numbers).
** The value of "name" is used by the HAL Driver I/F to search for the corresponding driver file.

<<<

Behavior During Errors and Recovery Method::
Check the registration details, such as duplicated device IDs.
Considerations::
None.
