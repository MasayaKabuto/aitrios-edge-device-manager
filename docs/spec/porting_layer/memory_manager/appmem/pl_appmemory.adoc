== Purpose and Scope

This document describes the specifications of the AppMemory region in the Memory impl layer, one of the implementation layers of AITRIOS PL. +
The AppMemory region is a memory region used at runtime by WASM (AoT). +
Therefore, the purpose of PL Appmemory is to absorb interface differences caused by SoC and memory size, and to provide access methods to memory for the upper-layer WASM.

* *Return Value* +
Returns a pointer to the memory block on success.

* *Description* +
** Reallocates memory from the AppMemory region or normal heap.

   To change the usage type, reallocate using `PlAppmemMalloc`.  
** If `mem_usage` and the origin of `oldmem` do not match, returns `NULL`.  
** If the pointer changes, the internal data is updated accordingly.  
** Behavior differs depending on `mem_usage`:  
** When `kPlAppLinearMemory` is specified:  
   - If the size exceeds the maximum block size, returns an error.  
   - If within the limit, the original pointer is returned without reallocation (fixed block size).  
** When `kPlAppHeap` is specified, reallocation is done from the heap.

== Notes and Component-specific Information
[#_Component_ESP32_S3]
=== Specifications for ESP32-S3
The memory map is shown below.

.Memory configuration
|====
|Name |Size
|Virtual AppMemory region |12 MB
|Physical AppMemory region |12 MB
|Maximum number of AppMemory region blocks |8
|====
Since the virtual and physical sizes of the AppMemory region are the same, it is always mapped. +
Therefore, the physical address corresponding to a virtual address is always fixed.

=== Specifications for ESP32
The memory map is shown below.
