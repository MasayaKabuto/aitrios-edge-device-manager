== Purpose and Scope

This document describes the specifications of the PL LED, which is one of the PL layers of the AITRIOS Edge System Framework. +
The purpose of PL LED is to absorb the differences that arise on each board regarding controllable LEDs, blinking functions, and available colors for illumination.

|Porting Layer. +
 A layer that absorbs differences in cameras and OS.

<<<

== Component Description

The PL LED layer consists of a PL I/F that can be used without being aware of camera/OS differences, +
with the purpose of absorbing these differences related to LED functions in cameras and OS. +
Additionally, it can be extended or modified according to the target camera.

=== Overview of the Component

The following software architecture diagram focuses on this block.

=== Detailed Explanation of the Component

Below is an example usage sequence of the PL LED. +
After executing <<#_PlLedInitialize, PlLedInitialize>>, the upper layer can use the PL LED API to utilize various LED functions.

=== State Transitions
The possible states of PL LED are shown in <<#_TableStates>>.

[#_TableStates]
.List of States
[width="100%", cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
|State |Description 

|LED_READY
|Initial state of the LED.

|LED_RUNNING
|The LED is ready for execution.

|LED_START
|The LED is in an active state. +
 *A sub-state of LED_RUNNING, where the state is maintained per LED.*

|LED_STOP
|The LED is in a stopped state. +
 *A sub-state of LED_RUNNING, where the state is maintained per LED.*
|===

In PL LED, the state transitions as shown in <<#_FigureState>>. +
Additionally, if an error occurs during any API execution, the state transition does not occur. +

[#_FigureState]
.State Transition Diagram
image::./images/led_state.png[scaledwidth="100%",align="center"]

The availability of each API and the destination states after execution are shown in <<#_TableStateTransition>>. +
The state name in the table indicates the destination state after the API execution, meaning that the API can be called. +
× indicates that the API cannot be accepted, and calling the API in this state will return an error without any state transition. +
For details on errors, refer to section 4.2.1. HalErrCode in the hal_overview.adoc.

Starts LED blinking/lighting.

* *Format* +
[source, C]
....
PlErrCode PlLedStart(uint32_t led_id, uint32_t color_id, const struct timespec *interval_ts)
....

* *Argument Description* +
**[IN] uint32_t led_id**:: 
The target LED number. +
Select from the information obtained by <<#_PlLedGetInfo, PlLedGetInfo>>. +
If the specified LED is already in a running state, an error is returned.
Call <<#_PlLedStop, PlLedStop>> to change the LED to a stopped state before calling this API.

**[IN] uint32_t color_id**:: 
The color of the LED. +
Select from the information obtained by <<#_PlLedGetInfo, PlLedGetInfo>>.

**[IN] const struct timespec *interval_ts**:: 
Specifies the blinking interval. The LED will light up for the specified time, then turn off for the specified time. This repeats until the PlLedStop API is called. +
To keep the LED on continuously, specify 0. +
For the minimum and maximum values of the blinking interval, refer to the interval_ts_min and interval_ts_max fields in the PlLedInfo structure obtained by the <<#_PlLedGetInfo, PlLedGetInfo>> API. +
If the specified time is below the minimum blinking unit (the minimum time for each ON and OFF period), it will be rounded up to the minimum blinking unit (50ms). +
(Example): if interval_ts_min = 100us, it will be rounded up to 50ms
** 99us -> Error
** 100us -> Rounded up to 50ms
** 10ms -> Rounded up to 50ms
** 55ms -> 100ms

* *Return Value* +
Returns one of the PlErrCode values based on the execution result.

* *Description* +
** Starts LED blinking/lighting.
** This API can be used after executing <<#_PlLedInitialize, PlLedInitialize>>.
** This API can be used when the specified LED is in an operational state.
** After lighting the LED, the specified LED transitions to a running state.
** This API is asynchronous.
** This API starts LED blinking/lighting. In blinking mode, the initial state is LED=ON, and it alternates between on and off based on the specified blinking interval.
** The priority of the LED thread is fixed internally and is set higher than that of the upper layer.
** Select the target LED and color from the information obtained by <<#_PlLedGetInfo, PlLedGetInfo>>.

TIP: If you want to perform complex operations such as alternating between red and green, handle it at the upper layer. +
     The PL LED only provides single-color blinking functionality.
